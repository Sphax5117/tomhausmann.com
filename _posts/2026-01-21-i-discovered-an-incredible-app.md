## I had a problem

Today, most of us spend hours on TikTok, Instagram, and others, without any real purpose and without learning much.

After several unsuccessful attempts, I finally managed to limit my screen time on Instagram to **15 minutes per day**.

But that's not the point.
 
In fact, since I no longer had a source of quick dopamine on my phone, I started obsessively checking... **my package tracking updates.**

I admit, it’s not great.

But honestly, knowing exactly where the item I was eagerly waiting for was located gave me that quick hit of dopamine. The problem was that I couldn't stop checking every hour!

So, I wanted to find an alternative for those moments when I pick up my phone unconsciously. That solution was **RSS feeds**.

## RSS feeds? What’s that?

To put it simply, an RSS feed is an information stream on the Internet. According to the dictionary, it is exactly:

> "A dynamic file produced automatically based on updates to a website."

It can be:
* Newspaper articles.
* Updates on YouTube videos.
* Subreddits.
* And much more.

The main goal is to access information without having to visit every single site.

The biggest advantage is that it allows you to create a **true selection** of the news and videos you receive. For example, you can imagine a feed mixing TikToks from a single creator, YouTube videos from another, and articles from a newspaper you enjoy.

The problem is that since this technology is quite old (we're talking about something that's 27 years old!), the apps that allow you to use it are often quite archaic as well.

Several times, I tried to create a decent selection. But every time, I was put off by the setup and search process of these apps (even though I'm a CS engineering student and I usually love that stuff).

So, I would give up and go back to my old habits.

That was until I discovered a really cool app: [Feeeeeed](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/feeeed-rss-reader-and-more/id1600187490).

> **PPS:** I never know how many "e"s are in the app's name.

So, Feeeeed is an **RSS feed aggregator** that allows you to create your own news cycle, your own feed.

It’s beautifully designed (unsurprisingly, the creator comes from [The Browser Company](https://www.thebrowser.company/), the people who made Arc).

Also, there are plenty of cool little features that have nothing to do with RSS:

* **Flashcards:** You can create them (personally, I put my common math derivatives in there...).
* **Gallery:** Having a random photo from your gallery appear in your feed.
* **Web Snippets:** Being able to take an extract from any website and put it in your feed.

In short, I think it's a healthier and more personalized way (in a good way) to consume information.
