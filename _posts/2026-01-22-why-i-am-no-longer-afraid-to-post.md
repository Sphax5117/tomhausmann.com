## Many want to be creators, few dare.

I've always been drawn to creation. Whether it was on a small scale, when I had a Minecraft YouTube channel, or on a larger scale, when I started getting interested in Design, fashion, and cinema.

However, for quite a long time, I stopped publishing.

From the age of 13 to 19, I was somewhat absent from platforms.

It was only recently that I realized that creating is what makes me tick.

But between that realization and actually posting, there is still a gap.

I had to learn how to cross it.

## How did I take the leap?

Honestly, there is no magic recipe.

The main thing is to be confident with the image you project on the Internet.

For example, I only reveal things here that I am totally comfortable with my future boss reading (even though I probably won't have a boss).

After that, there is also a mindset to adopt.

**1. Try to take your stats lightly.**

It's easier said than done, I know. I tend to check my stats excessively myself.

But when they aren't good, I put things into perspective. I tell myself that, at least, I posted.

**2. Post without overthinking it**

As mentioned above, only share what you are sure you can own up to.

Then, you have to stop asking yourself 15,000 questions and just hit publish.

If we take the example of this blog, I write it without really proofreading, and I just have Gemini correct my spelling mistakes (oops...).

Then, I send it, and I don't check if the article performed well (because honestly, I don't have stats on this blog).

Anyway, it all depends on your relationship with how others see you.

In my opinion, if the people around me belittle what I do, they don't deserve to stay around me.

(Note that constructive criticism is super important, though, and I am [very interested in your feedback](mailto:t.hausmann@protonmail.com), if you have any.)

## Opportunities

And honestly, publishing also allows you to meet people—in short, to get new opportunities.

It's a way to show your art, and also to keep a record of all this for yourself.

I can only encourage you to do it.
