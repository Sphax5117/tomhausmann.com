## You already know this: we are pushed to consume.

On the Internet, you can find a ton of videos and articles praising the merits of this or that product.

They tell you it's going to significantly increase your productivity.

And in the end, you spend €300 on items that don't help you.

Originally, I wanted to write a simple article about my setup.

But I thought that wasn't the most interesting approach.

I prefer to show you 5 objects that have had a real impact on my productivity.

## Paper and pencil

You didn't expect that one, did you!

It's true, when we think of productivity, we often think of super high-tech and expensive gadgets.

But one of the things I've discovered is that my brain appreciates more or less tangible objects.

As a CS student, you can imagine I know that taking notes on my PC is way more optimal.

However, I can't get away from paper for certain things.

In fact, putting my thoughts down on paper has several effects:

- **First, it relaxes me.**
- **Next, it allows me to visualize what I'm writing in a different way.**
- **And finally, it's a way for me to keep a tangible record of what I'm doing.**

I do two things in my notebooks.

First, I try to write down my thoughts, day after day. It's particularly effective for managing stress because, as soon as I write, all the stressful thoughts become a bit ridiculous.

Then, it also helps me track my habits! I implemented this system thanks to this [newsletter by Paul Barbosa](https://paulbarbosa.substack.com/p/comment-reussir-ta-journee-en-5-minutes).

And honestly, it's pretty effective because as soon as I get home, I see my notebook open to that page (writing this newsletter is actually one of my daily habits, haha).

## AirPods Pro 2

Okay, now we're getting a bit more technical.

Actually, my AirPods are very important to me for a simple reason: I am very sensitive to noise.

As soon as there's a lot of noise, I develop a pretty annoying headache.

That's where the AirPods helped me a lot: they have insane noise cancellation.

(By the way, I think the AirPods Pro 3 are even better at this, but I haven't tried them yet.)

So, let me tell you, since I got them, it has really changed my life.

And since I'm also a big music fan, having a good audio system at my fingertips helps me stay focused.

## My MacBook Pro

Okay, I admit I said I wasn't going to talk about super high-tech and expensive objects...

But ever since I switched to macOS, I've really felt a gain in productivity.

I'm not saying Windows is bad, mind you! I spent 10 years of my life on it, and in some aspects, it's great.

But what I like about my MacBook is that:

- I have access to software that is generally better designed and more pleasant to use.
- I don't need to install 200 drivers to make my computer work.
- It's a robust machine; it will last a long time.

That said, if you don't do editing or intensive tasks, you don't need to buy a MacBook Pro.

Some rumors talk about a €700 MacBook by the end of the year. If it really exists, it could be a very good investment.

## My E-reader

I've always been a big reader. The real problem is that, as a student, it can be difficult to afford books. And on top of that, since we have a busy schedule, it becomes complicated to lug a book around everywhere.

That's where an e-reader is really useful.

Books are often much cheaper, and best of all, you can take them everywhere!

My e-reader fits in my pocket, so instead of taking out my phone on the subway, I read.

And by doing that, I've already read 2 books since the start of 2026.

> **PS:** The book in the photo is incredible; it changed my perception of history and the world, haha!

## One last piece of advice: do what feels right

With all these lists and comparisons, you can quickly feel overwhelmed. Feeling like you always need more to finally get to work.

I advise you to make your own list, try a couple of things, and, if possible, buy second-hand (which is the case for my MacBook).

It's more eco-friendly, and if you find a good deal, you get good gear.

At the end of the day, being disciplined and putting in the effort every day is the most effective thing to do.
