### At first, a read

> Recently, I read **"Show your Work"** by [Austin Kleon](https://www.google.com/search?q=Austin+Kleon). In it, he invites readers to create their own website.

And, in this new year 2026, this concept might seem a bit outdated. Even worse, you would have to write **yourself**, without using AI...

And yet.

Yet, I think writing remains one of the things that allows us to **learn** the most.

* Learn to write better,
* Learn about those who read us,
* And, even more importantly, **learn about ourselves**.

So, here I am, writing this first article at 20:32, on a Sunday evening.

To start, we are going to define together what I want to do with it (which is surely bound to evolve).


### Next, encounters

I have always loved **meeting people**, and one of my goals in life is to provoke these encounters.

So, it is only natural that one of the goals of this blog is to meet more people, whether on the Internet or IRL!

If you have a question, an idea, a criticism, or anything else, send me an email [here](mailto:t.hausmann@protonmail.com)

The idea is that one of the end goals of this blog and my YouTube channel is to organize **events**, in **Paris and elsewhere**, to bring forth ideas, collaborations, and more broadly, good times.



### Finally, a philosophy

I am by no means a guru, a scholar, or anything else. **I am 19 years old** and I am still young and inexperienced!

I am not selling you anything (and, if that **were** to happen, it would be with the greatest **transparency**!).

And above all, I wish for debate. For now, it is not possible to leave comments on the blog, but it is potentially something I could add.

I will also try to **share as much as possible** what I learn, where I fail, and where I succeed.

In **any** case, my emails remain open, and I would be delighted to converse with you!


Anyway, welcome to my little corner of the internet!

Tom
